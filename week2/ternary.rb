# Ternary operators
# Exercise 1:
# Use ternary operator to rewrite the following code. 
# score = 70
# if score >= 70
#     puts "hooray! you passed"
# else
#     puts "sorry, try again next time"
# end
# Try changing the value of the variable "score" to make sure you code works!

score = 80
score >= 70 ? (puts "hooray! you passed") : (puts "sorry, try again next time")
